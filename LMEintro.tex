In matrix notation a mixed model can be represented as
\boldsymbol{y} = X \boldsymbol{\beta} + Z \boldsymbol{u} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
where
\boldsymbol{y} is a known vector of observations, with mean E(\boldsymbol{y}) = X \boldsymbol{\beta};
\boldsymbol{\beta} is an unknown vector of fixed effects;
\boldsymbol{u} is an unknown vector of random effects, with mean E(\boldsymbol{u})=\boldsymbol{0} and variance-covariance matrix \operatorname{var}(\boldsymbol{u})=G;
\boldsymbol{\epsilon} is an unknown vector of random errors, with mean E(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\boldsymbol{0} and variance \operatorname{var}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=R;
X and Z are known design matrices relating the observations \boldsymbol{y} to \boldsymbol{\beta} and \boldsymbol{u}, respectively.
