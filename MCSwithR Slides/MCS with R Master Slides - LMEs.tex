\begin{itemize}
\item 
The absence of inter-method bias by itself is not sufficient to
establish whether two measurement methods agree. 
\item The two
methods must also have equivalent levels of precision. 
\item Should one
method yield results considerably more variable than that of the
other, they can not be considered to be in agreement. 
\item With this in
mind a methodology is required that allows an analyst to estimate
the inter-method bias, and to compare the precision of both
methods of measurement.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The above formulation doesn't require the data set to be balanced.
%However, it does require a sufficient large number of replicates
%and measurements to overcome the problem of identifiability. The
%import of which is that more than two methods of measurement may
%be required to carry out the analysis. 
%\item There is also the
%assumptions that observations of measurements by particular
%methods are exchangeable within subjects. (Exchangeability means
%that future samples from a population behaves like earlier
%samples).
%\end{itemize}


%\alert{BXC2004} describes the above model as a `functional model',
%similar to models described by \alert{Kimura}, but without any
%assumptions on variance ratios. A functional model is . An
%alternative to functional models is structural modelling
%\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}
%Carstensen \textit{et al} [4] uses the above formula to predict observations for
%a specific individual $i$ by method $m$;
%
%\begin{equation}BLUP_{mir} = \hat{\alpha_{m}} + \hat{\beta_{m}}\mu_{i} +
%c_{mi} \end{equation}. Under the assumption that the $\mu$s are
%the true item values, this would be sufficient to estimate
%parameters. When that assumption doesn't hold, regression
%techniques (known as updating techniques) can be used additionally
%to determine the estimates. The assumption of exchangeability can
%be unrealistic in certain situations. Carstensen \textit{et al}[4] provides an
%amended formulation which includes an extra interaction term ($
%d_{mr} \sim N(0,\omega^{2}_{m}$)to account for this.

\frametitle{Roy's method}
\large
\begin{itemize}
\item Roy 2009 [6] formulates a very powerful method of assessing whether two methods of measurement, with replicate measurements, also using LME models.
\item  Roy's approach is based on the construction of variance-covariance matrices.
\item Importantly, Roy's approach does not address the issue of limits of agreement (though another related analysis , the coefficient of repeatability, is mentioned).
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Roy's method}
\begin{itemize}
\item Roy proposes a novel method using the LME model with Kronecker product covariance structure in a doubly multivariate set-up to assess the agreement between a new method and an established method with unbalanced data and with unequal replications for different subjects [6].
\item 
Using Roy's method, four candidate models are constructed, each differing by constraints applied to the variance covariance matrices.
\item In addition to computing the inter-method bias, three significance tests are carried out on the respective formulations to make a judgement on whether or not two methods are in agreement.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{frame}{\bf \tcb{Roy's Approach}}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.4cm
\item Roy proposes an LME model with Kronecker product covariance structure in a doubly multivariate setup.
\item Response for $i$th subject can be written as
\[ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \beta_2x_{i2} + b_{1i}z_{i1}  + b_{2i}z_{i2} + \epsilon_i \]
\item $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are fixed effects corresponding to both methods. ($\beta_0$ is the intercept.)
\item $b_{1i}$ and $b_{2i}$ are random effects corresponding to both methods.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{frame}{\bf \tcb{Roy's LME model}}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.7cm

\item Let $\boldsymbol{y}_i$ be the set of responses for subject $i$ ( in matrix form).
\item $\boldsymbol{y}_i = \boldsymbol{X}_i\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{Z}_i \boldsymbol{b}_i + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i$
\item $\boldsymbol{b}_i \sim N_m(0,\boldsymbol{D})$  (m: number of methods)
\item $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i \sim N_{n_i}(0,\boldsymbol{R})$ ($n_i$: number of measurements on subject $i$)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Roy (2009) -  Model terms}
It is important to note the following characteristics of this model.
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.0cm
\item Let the number of replicate measurements on each item $i$ for both methods be $n_i$, hence $2 \times n_i$ responses. However, it is assumed that there may be a different number of replicates made for different items. Let the maximum number of replicates be $p$. An item will have up to $2p$ measurements, i.e. $\max(n_{i}) = 2p$.

% \item $\boldsymbol{y}_i$ is the $2n_i \times 1$ response vector for measurements on the $i-$th item.
% \item $\boldsymbol{X}_i$ is the $2n_i \times  3$ model matrix for the fixed effects for observations on item $i$.
% \item $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is the $3 \times  1$ vector of fixed-effect coefficients, one for the true value for item $i$, and one effect each for both methods.

\item Later on $\boldsymbol{X}_i$ will be reduced to a $2 \times 1$ matrix, to allow estimation of terms. This is due to a shortage of rank. The fixed effects vector can be modified accordingly.
\item $\boldsymbol{Z}_i$ is the $2n_i \times  2$ model matrix for the random effects for measurement methods on item $i$.
\item $\boldsymbol{b}_i$ is the $2 \times  1$ vector of random-effect coefficients on item $i$, one for each method.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Roy(2009) -  Model terms}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.4cm
\item $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$  is the $2n_i \times  1$ vector of residuals for measurements on item $i$.
\item $\boldsymbol{G}$ is the $2 \times  2$ covariance matrix for the random effects.
\item $\boldsymbol{R}_i$ is the $2n_i \times  2n_i$ covariance matrix for the residuals on item $i$.
\item The expected value is given as $\mbox{E}(\boldsymbol{y}_i) = \boldsymbol{X}_i\boldsymbol{\beta}.$ 
\item The variance of the response vector is given by $\mbox{Var}(\boldsymbol{y}_i)  = \boldsymbol{Z}_i \boldsymbol{G} \boldsymbol{Z}_i^{\prime} + \boldsymbol{R}_i$ . 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection*{Variance Covariance Matrices}
\begin{frame}{\bf \tcb{Variance-covariance matrix}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall variance covariance matrix for response vector $\boldsymbol{y}_i$

\[ \mbox{Cov}(\boldsymbol{y}_i)= \boldsymbol{Z}_i \boldsymbol{D}\boldsymbol{Z}^{\prime}_i + \boldsymbol{R}_i \]

\item can be re-expressed as follows:
\[\boldsymbol{Z}_i \left[ \begin{array}{cc} d^2_1 & d_{12}\\
d_{12} & d^2_2\\ \end{array}\right]\boldsymbol{Z}^{\prime}_i  +  \left(V \otimes \left[\begin{array}{cc} \sigma^2_1 & \sigma_{12}\\
\sigma_{12} & \sigma^2_2\\ \end{array}\right] \right)
\]

\item Overall variability between the two methods is sum of between-subject and within-subject variability,
\[
 \mbox{Block } \boldsymbol{\Omega}_i = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} d^2_1 & d_{12}\\ d_{12} & d^2_2\\ \end{array} \right]
+ \left[\begin{array}{cc} \sigma^2_1 & \sigma_{12}\\ \sigma_{12} & \sigma^2_2\\ \end{array}\right].
\]

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Variance Covariance Matrices }
\large
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.4cm
\item Under Roy's model, random effects are defined using a bivariate normal distribution. 
\item Consequently, the variance-covariance structures can be described using $2 \times 2$  matrices. \item A discussion of the various structures a variance-covariance matrix can be specified under is required before progressing. 
\item The following structures are relevant:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the identity structure, 
\item the compound symmetric structure
\item the symmetric structure.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%-------------------------------------------%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Variance Covariance Matrices }
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{identity} structure is simply an abstraction of the identity matrix. 
\item The \textbf{compound symmetric} structure and \textbf{symmetric} structure can be described with reference to the following matrix (here in the context of the overall covariance Block-$\boldsymbol{\Omega}_i$, but equally applicable to the component variabilities $\boldsymbol{G}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$);

\[\left( \begin{array}{cc}
              \omega^2_1  & \omega_{12} \\
              \omega_{12} & \omega^2_2 \\
\end{array}\right) \]
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\begin{frame}{\bf \tcb{Variance-covariance matrix}}
\[\left( \begin{array}{cc}
              \omega^2_1  & \omega_{12} \\
              \omega_{12} & \omega^2_2 \\
\end{array}\right) \]
\begin{itemize}
\item Symmetric structure requires the equality of all the diagonal terms, hence $\omega^2_1 = \omega^2_2$. 
\item Conversely compound symmetry make no such constraint on the diagonal elements. 
\item Under the identity structure, $\omega_{12} = 0$.
\item A comparison of a model fitted using symmetric structure with that of a model fitted using the compound symmetric structure is equivalent to a test of the equality of variance.

\end{itemize}


%In the presented example, it is shown that Roy's LOAs are lower than those of Carstensen et al, when covariance between methods is present.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Symmetric structure specifies that $\sigma^2_1$ may differ from $\sigma^2_2$.
%\item Compound symmetric structure specifies that $\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2$.

\frametitle{Likelihood Ratio Tests}
\begin{itemize}
\item The relationship between the respective models presented by \alert{roy} is known as ``nesting".
A model A to be nested in the reference model, model B, if Model A is a special case of Model B, or with some specific constraint applied.
\item 
A general method for comparing models with a nesting relationship is the \textbf{likelihood ratio test (LRTs)}. 
\item LRTs are a family of tests used to compare the value of likelihood functions for two models, whose respective formulations define a hypothesis to be tested (i.e. the nested and reference model). 
\item The significance of the likelihood ratio test can be found by comparing the likelihood ratio to the $\chi^2$ distribution, with the appropriate degrees of freedom.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%-------------------------------------------------%
%\begin{frame}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item When testing hypotheses around covariance parameters in an LME model, REML estimation for both models is recommended by West et al. REML estimation can be shown to reduce the bias inherent in ML estimates of covariance parameters \alert{west}.
%\item Conversely, \alert{pb} advises that testing hypotheses on fixed-effect parameters should be based on ML estimation, and that using REML would not be appropriate in this context.

\begin{itemize}
\item Can perform a test for equality of overall variances.\\
\vspace{0.25cm}\item This can be done by specifying a compound symmetry structure for both between-subject and within-subject variances when constructing a nested model.\\
\vspace{0.25cm}\item Roy controls the family-wise error rate in paper, using Bonferroni correction procedure.

%---Carstensen's limits of agreement
%---The between item variances are not individually computed. An estimate for their sum is used.
%---The within item variances are indivdually specified.
%---Carstensen remarks upon this in his book (page 61), saying that it is "not often used".
%---The Carstensen model does not include covariance terms for either VC matrices.
%---Some of Carstensens estimates are presented, but not extractable, from R code, so calculations have to be done by %---hand.
%--Importantly, estimates required to calculate the limits of agreement are not extractable, and therefore the calculation must be done by hand.
%---All of Roys stimates are  extractable from R code, so automatic compuation can be implemented
%---When there is negligible covariance between the two methods, Roys LoA and Carstensen's LoA are roughly the same.
%---When there is covariance between the two methods, Roy's LoA and Carstensen's LoA differ, Roys usually narrower.


%%---Estimability of Tau
%When only two methods are compared, \citet{BXC2008} notes that separate estimates of $\tau^2_m$ can not be obtained %due to the model over-specification. To overcome this, the assumption of equality, i.e. $\tau^2_1 = \tau^2_2$, is %required.

%With regards to the specification of the variance terms, Carstensen  remarks that using their approach is common, %remarking that \emph{ The only slightly non-standard (meaning ``not often used") feature is the differing residual %variances between methods }\citep{bxc2010}.
