\textbf{Important : Scope of MCS Problem}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Method Comparison specifically deals with methods of measurement.
\item Other matters, such as the change in patient measurements over time, are not considered. 
\\ (However the proposed methodology may be adapted to model thos problems).
\item For the sake of brevity, we will only consider Method Comparison Studies only.

\begin{itemize}
\item Controversial Topic, but important to mention as it demonstrates the prevalence of Method Comparison in medical research.
\item Arguably, any new approach must incorporate the Bland-Altman methodology if it is to expect widespread use.

\begin{itemize}
\item The syntax for fitting LME models with nlme can be very challenging, particularly when fitting complicated models.
\item However - it is a job that has to be done only once.

\noindent \textbf{Statement of Estimates}

\begin{itemize}
\item The main estimates are derived from the "Ref" Model. 
\item These estimates are the inter-method bias, the between-subject variance matrix and the within subject variance matrix.
\item Limits of Agreement may be computed from the overall variance matrix - Full Bland-Altman plot may be construted.
\item Remark: The summary output of the fitted model is quite challenging to read.
